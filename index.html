		<h2>About Balloonlum</h2>
		<p>SCP 1537, also know as Balloonlum is believed to be a species that desguises itself as a floating balloon inorder to lure people in so that it can devourer them. They seem to take the apperance of there victims afterward, we are unsure if this is just an apperance or if the victim is still alive inside as they seem to be unresponsive. So far there is only one reported incident of this happening and we are unsure of what this SCP wants as it seems to now be passive after devouring it's victim.</p>
