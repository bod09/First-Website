		<h2>About Balloonlum</h2>
		<p>SCP 1537, also know as Balloonlum is believed to be a species that disguises itself as a floating balloon in order to lure people in so that it can devour them. They seem to take the appearance of their victims afterwards, we are unsure if this is just an appearance or if the victim is still alive inside as they seem to be unresponsive. So far there is only one reported incident of this happening and we are unsure of what this SCP wants as it seems to now be passive after devouring its victim.</p>
